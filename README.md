##Welcome

Welcome to the open code repository for the Direct Certificate Discovery Tool (DCDT).

The DCDT was created to support automated testing of systems implementing the Direct Certificate Discovery and Provider Directory Implementation Guidance, approved as normative specification by the Direct community, as of July 9, 2012. It is based on the written test package and requirement traceability matrix created by the Modular Specifications project by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The DCDT is planned to be used for Meaningful Use Stage 2 (MU2) and will be rolled into NIST's overall testing toolkit over time. Issues or feedback received from community usage will be prioritized as received, and the tool will have releases as needed.

##Additional Info
Visit the [documentation space](http://confluence.siframework.org/x/AgA1Ag) for an introduction to the Direct project, certificate discovery implementation guidance, an FAQ, and all other DCDT-related documentation. You can submit issues, or see what we're currently working on, [here](http://jira.oncprojectracking.org/browse/DCDT).

A demo version of the DCDT can be found at: [http://sitenv.org/direct-certificate-discovery-tool](http://sitenv.org/direct-certificate-discovery-tool).

User forums, for support and discussion, can be found at: [http://groups.google.com/group/directtesttool](http://groups.google.com/group/directtesttool). Please note that while the DCDT development team is committed to providing excellent technical support to the external community, we must realistically set certain technical thresholds of support. We are unfortunately unable to support issues at the granularity of, detailed network/firewall configuration, Direct RI installation walkthroughs, system administration, etc. DCDT is a relatively complex software system, and as such requires experienced network/software/systems engineering resources to install, configure, and use it.
